# Personal Website Repository

## What is it ?
I created a website for my personal purpose that you can find here: https://www.sebastien-abg.fr it contains some info about me, my skills, my social link and will probably be upgraded to contains some blog tickets or thing like that ;)

## Technology used
I used React and Vite.js to create this website, and because I'm a really bad designer I also used [nes.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) to make it wonderfull !

## Feel free to take it and change it as you like

I think reading the package.json is self explanatory and because it will change soon, I will write a tutorial later
